## Use Case

- The owner of the smart contract can propose an idea and deploy the smart contract asking for funds.

- Before deploying the maximum number of contributers can be defined(Currently set at 3 for testing purpose)

- Once the number of contributer limit is reached the funds are locked.

- When progress on project has been made then the Owner can ask the contributers to pay the developers. Only 10% of the original contribution is dispered to the developers per voting, hence the developers are paid in 10 installments this motivates them to keep progressing on the project.

- If the conributers are not happy with the progress of the project they can demand their money back. If they get 2/3rd majority the remaining balance in the can be claimed by the contributors on proportion of their initial contribution.

- If the contributors are happy with the progress of the project they can vote to pay the developers. If 2/3rd majority is happy with the progress the money is automatically transferred to the developers.

This mechanism ensures that the developers are kept motivated to progress on the project otherise they cannot claim their rewards and the contributors can get back their money.
